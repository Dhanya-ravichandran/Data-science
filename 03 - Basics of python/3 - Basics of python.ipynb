        "1. **Handle base cases:** You correctly identify that numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.\n",
        "2. **Iterate through potential divisors:** You iterate from 2 up to the square root of the input number. This is an efficient optimization because if a number has a divisor greater than its square root, it must also have a divisor smaller than its square root.\n",
        "3. **Check for divisibility:** You use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the input number is divisible by any number in the iteration range.\n",
        "4. **Determine primality:** If a divisor is found, the number is not prime, and you use `break` to exit the loop early. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the number is prime, and you use the `else` block of the `for` loop to print the result.\n",
